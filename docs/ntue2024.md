## Searching for a function

- The goal of ML/DL is to search for a _function_ that takes some input and then produces some output in a way that humans would normally do.

## Prompt engineering skill - language

<!-- _class: bq-red hugetext-->

> Linguistics,
>
> the scientific study of language and its structure, plays a vital role in prompt engineering. It helps in:
>
> 1. **Understanding Language Structure**: Helps in designing effective prompts.
> 2. **Semantic Analysis**: Understanding the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences helps in creating more precise prompts.
> 3. **Pragmatics**: Understanding the context in which language is used can lead to the creation of more effective prompts.

## Take-away messages

> 3 points
>
> - **Interdisciplinary integration**: Generative AI and prompt engineering are not just for tech enthusiasts or computer science majors. They can be incredibly useful tools for humanities majors as well.
> - **Creativity amplified**: Generative AI can be seen as a tool to amplify human creativity, not replace it. Remember, the AI is just a tool, the real creativity comes from you.
> - **Doing by saying**: The field of generative AI heavily relies on understanding and manipulating language. This is where knowledge of linguistics comes in. Understanding how language works can help you better utilize and even improve these tools.
